# Racial Bias in Police Shootings

Here, I try to reproduce [ctross](https://github.com/ctross)'s
[article](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141854)
in a Jupyter notebook. The data and scripts are freely available in
the SI from his article, but don't seem to be preproduced on his
github site. I want to clarify that I'm just trying to follow along;
mistakes are mine, smart stuff is his.
